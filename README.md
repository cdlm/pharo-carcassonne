# An object-oriented implementation of Carcassonne

[Carcassonne](http://www.hans-im-glueck.de/english/) is a well-known tabletop
game where you build a map of adjacent tiles, and claim points by building and
claiming cities, roads, and fields.

This started as an experiment in OO design, in [Pharo](http://pharo.org).
